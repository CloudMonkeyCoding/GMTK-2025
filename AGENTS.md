These instructions apply to the entire repository.

- Run `python -m pytest` and ensure it passes before committing any change.
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Keep the working tree clean; commit only the files related to your change.
- Avoid committing large binary assets when possible.
- Prefer `rg` for searching through the repository instead of `grep -R` or `ls -R`.
